This is a C++ learning project of mine.
I am aiming to develop a football tournament organizer software.
After specifying the type of tournament and entering the number and their names, the software will automatically generate matchs calendar allowing the users to enter the match results.
The software will then generates ranking, qualifying teams, champions, etc....
At the end, the software will be able to handle nationale league, multigoup tournament, direct qualifying tournament, home/away matchs, etc....

The software will be developped for console at first and will serve, after its completion, as a tool for learning GUI usage and development.

Current development status:
- Reading and storing participating teams names
- Reading and storing match results
- Ranking
- Displaying groups and ranks

Features to add:
- Calendar generator for groups with an even number of teams
- Groups with home/away matchs
- Calendar generator for groups with an odd number of teams
- Handling tournaments with multiple groups
- Handling group qualifications
- Handling direct qualification matchs
- User interface
