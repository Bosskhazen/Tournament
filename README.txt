This is a C++ learning project of mine.
I am aiming to develop a football tournament organizer software.
After specifying the type of tournament and entering the number of teams and their names, the software will automatically generate match calendar allowing the user to enter the match results.
The software will then generates ranking, qualifying teams, champions, etc....
At the end, the software will be able to handle national leaguex, multi group tournaments, direct qualifying tournaments, home/away matchs, etc.

The software will be developped for console at first and will serve, after its completion, as a tool for learning GUI usage and development.

Current development status:
- Reading and storing participating teams names
- Reading and storing match results
- Ranking
- Displaying groups and ranks
- Calendar generator for groups with an even number of teams
- Displaying calendar
- Calendar generator for groups with an odd number of teams

Features to add:
- Groups with home/away matchs
- Handling tournaments with multiple groups
- Handling group qualifications
- Handling direct qualification matchs
- User interface
- Saving and exporting calendar and results to a readable file
